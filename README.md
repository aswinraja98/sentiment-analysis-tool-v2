## 🎯 Problem Statement

In today's digital world, understanding user sentiment is crucial for businesses, researchers, and developers. Manual sentiment analysis is time-consuming and subjective. There's a need for automated systems that can:

- Accurately classify text sentiment (positive, negative, neutral)
- Provide real-time feedback for user-generated content
- Integrate easily into web applications
- Scale to production environments

## 💡 Solution

This project implements a robust sentiment analysis tool using VADER:

- **VADER Sentiment Analysis**: Lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis specifically designed for social media and short texts.
- **Next.js API Route**: Sentiment analysis runs directly in the API route for seamless integration.
- **No Backend Required**: All logic is handled in JavaScript, making deployment simple and fast.
